Pharmacy viewer is a educational purpose project made with [Angular 8](https://angular.io/), [ngx-Leaflet](https://github.com/Asymmetrik/ngx-leaflet) and [Clarity UI Library](https://clarity.design/).

It makes use of [API Rest Zaragoza](https://www.zaragoza.es/sede/portal/datos-abiertos/api) city data.
